    <h4>Think about your question and chose one or three cards:</h4>

    <p><strong><a href="/one-card">draw one random card</a></strong>
        <br />(the answer to your question)</p>

    <p><strong><a href="/three-cards">draw three random cards</a></strong>
    <br />(the past, present and future of the matter)</p>

    <hr />

    <p><strong><a href="/all-cards">list all the cards</strong></a>

    <h4>WTF?</h4>

    <p>This little website is a simple application written in Python to draw one or three randomly selected tarot cards from a dictionary of 72 descriptions and image references. <a href="https://github.com/jeremytarling/python-tarot">The source code to this app is here</a> - please feel free to fork or re-use, there are no license restrictions.</p>

    <p>The tarot images are <a href="http://www.cbdtarot.com/download/" target="_new">Yoav Ben Dov's</a> restoration of <a href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b10520316w?rk=42918;4" target="_new">Nicholas Conver's deck</a> from 1760. For deeper study of the images I recommend <a href="https://tarot-history.com/jean-noblet/" target="new">Jean-Claude Flornoy's</a> restoration of <a href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b105109641" target="new">Jean Noblet's deck</a> from 1650, the work of a true master.</p>

    <p>My name is <a href="https://linktr.ee/jeremytarling">Jeremy Tarling</a> and I work as a data specialist at the BBC. I've been fascinated by the tarot since childhood when my aunty first introduced me to the cards.</p>
