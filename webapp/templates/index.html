    <h4>WTF</h4>

    <p>My name is <a href="https://linktr.ee/jeremytarling">Jeremy Tarling</a> and I work as a data specialist at the BBC. I've been fascinated by the tarot since childhood when my aunty first introduced me to the cards.</p>

    <p>This little website is a simple application written in Python to draw one or more randomly selected tarot cards from a dictionary of 72 descriptions and image references.</p>

    <p>The tarot images are my own captures of <a href="https://tarot-history.com/jean-noblet/" target="new">Jean-Claude Flornoy's</a> wonderful restoration of Jean Noblet's deck, in the Marseille tradition.</p>
