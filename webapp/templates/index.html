    <h3>Welcome to the Tarot!</h3>

    <p>Having trouble making a decision? Worried about the future? Concerned that secret forces are controlling your destiny? Then it's time to consult the Tarot..</p>

    <p>Think about your question and chose one or three cards:</p>

    <p><a href="/one-card">draw one random card</a>
    <br />(the answer to your question)</p>

    <p><a href="/three-cards">draw three random cards</a>
    <br />(the past, the present and future of the matter)</p>

    <p><a href="/all-cards">list all the cards</a>

	<hr />

    <p>This is a simple web application written in Python to draw one or more randomly selected cards from a dictionary (hash) of 72 Tarot card description and image references.</p>
