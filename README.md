# python-tarot

This is a simple web application written in Python to draw one or more randomly selected cards from a dictionary of 72 Tarot card description and image references.

Deployed to Heroku here: https://python-tarot.herokuapp.com/

Please feel free to fork or re-use, no license restrictions (the tarot images are my captures of Jean Noblet's deck).
