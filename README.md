# python-tarot

This is a simple web application written in Python to draw one or more randomly selected cards from a dictionary of 78 Tarot card description and image references.

Deployed to Heroku here: https://python-tarot.herokuapp.com/

Please feel free to fork or re-use, no license restrictions (the tarot images are Yoav Ben Dov's version of the Marseille tarot, available here: http://www.cbdtarot.com/download/).
